# Embracing new Ops culture
Klok Tech people started as system administrators, network administrators, security engineers and automating heros.  As time progress, more and more machines are deploy and more tools are needed to manage every part of infrastructure.  Today, as company setting up infrastructure on clouds or on premise, the basic challenges didn't change, it's still about who can setup faster and cheaper.

# What do we do?
Our clients spread across predictive analytics, AI, ERP Management, realtime messaging platform and etc.  Although the applications are different, infrastructure to run them as well as skills to maintain/monitor are the same.  And that is why we can provide high value to organization because of the specialization and ability to share talents among clients.
