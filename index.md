# Embracing new Ops culture
Founders of Klok Tech started out as system administrators, network administrators, automating here and there as it fit.  As time progress, more and more machines are deploy and more tools are needed to manage every part of infrastructure.  Today, as company setting up infrastructure on clouds and on-prem, the basic challenges didn't change, it's still about who can setup faster and cheaper wins the game.  Just the playing ground has shifted.

# What we do?
