# Embracing new Ops culture
People in Klok Tech started out as system administrators, network administrators, automating here and there as it fit.  As time progress, more and more machines are deploy and more tools are needed to manage every part of infrastructure.  Today, as company setting up infrastructure on clouds and on-prem, the basic challenges didn't change, it's still about who can setup faster and cheaper wins the game.

# What do we do?

```bash
kloktech create infrastructure
kloktech create deployment
kloktech create monitoring
kloktech create integration
kloktech create scale
```

Our clients are in wide range of fields such predictive analytics, AI, ERP Management, realtime messaging platform and etc.  Although the applications are different, infrastructure to run them as well as skills to maintain/monitor are the same.  Hence why we can deliver high value to organization because of the specialization and ability to manage multiple clients at once.
