# Embracing new Ops culture
Founders of Kloktech started out as system administrators, network administrators, automating here and there as it fit.  As time progress, more and more machines are deploy and more tools are needed to manage every part of infrastructure.  Today, as company setting up infrastructure on clouds and on-prem, the basic challenges didn't change, it's still who can setup faster and cheaper.  Just the playing ground has shifted.

# What we do?

```bash
kloktech create infrastructure
kloktech create deployment
kloktech create monitoring
kloktech create integration
kloktech create scale
```
